title: Andmejälgija / Personal Data Monitor
---

Personal Data Monitor, *Andmejälgija* in Estonian, is a set of 4 [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)-style  applications that, when combined with each other and attached to X-Road can offer the citizen the comprehensive view of how his or her personal data has been used by the government.

Each component is designed to be simple, "dumb". That means the component performs a single, clear function and communicates with its environment via clean APIs. Component requires only limited view and understanding of its environment. 

The power lies in how the components are connected to each other and the elements of X-Road.

**Extractor** (*et* *Eraldusfilter*) watches Information System's outbound traffic and filters out the messages where personal data is being sent out from the Information System. A personal data usage log record is created for each such event. The log record contains metadata about personal data usage: person's ID, date, name of the X-Road service, name of the message recipient agency and the purpose of the personal data use (if available). Personal data itself, however, is neither extracted from the message nor recorded. Extractor is placed as a proxy between X-Road Security Server and governmental Information System.  

**Personal Data Usage Logger** (*et* *Andmesalvestaja*) stores the personal data usage log record in database. Contents of the database is made available for request by the person.  

**Personal Data Usage Viewer** (*et* *Esitleja*) offers the citizen, through UI, the comprehensive view of how his or her personal data has been used by the government.  

**Personal Data Usage Verifier** (*et* *Kontrollija*) offers the Information System's auditor to view the personal data usage log.
